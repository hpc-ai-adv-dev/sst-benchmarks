# infiniteLoop

## Situation

An event is supposed to move onward to D, but A, B, and C keep forwarding it in a cycle, creating an infinite loop.

## To try it out:

`sst --interactive-start infiniteLoop.py`

-or-

`./doit infiniteLoop`

## Approach 1 -- run step by step and print

```
> p A
A (SST::Component)
 component_state_ = 3 (SST::BaseComponent::ComponentState)
 my_info_ ()
 my_info_ (SST::ComponentInfo*)
 name = A (std::string)

 value = 0 (int)
 visited = 1 (int)
> run 2ns
Entering interactive mode at time 2000
Ran clock for 2000 sim cycles
