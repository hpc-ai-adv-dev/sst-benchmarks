# badInitialState

## Situation

Four unconnected components are intended to initialize to the same state, but C starts with a different value than the others.

## To try it out:

```
sst --interactive-start badInitialState.py
```

-or-

```
./doit badInitialState
```

## Approach 1 -- print component statates on startup

```
Entering interactive mode at time 0
Interactive start at 0
> p A
A (SST::Component)
 component_state_ = 3 (SST::BaseComponent::ComponentState)
 my_info_ ()
 my_info_ (SST::ComponentInfo*)
 name = A (std::string)
 valid = 1 (bool)
 value = 1 (int)
 visited = 0 (int)
> p B
B (SST::Component)
 component_state_ = 3 (SST::BaseComponent::ComponentState)
 my_info_ ()
 my_info_ (SST::ComponentInfo*)
 name = B (std::string)
 valid = 1 (bool)
 value = 1 (int)
 visited = 0 (int)
> p C
C (SST::Component)
 component_state_ = 3 (SST::BaseComponent::ComponentState)
 my_info_ ()
 my_info_ (SST::ComponentInfo*)
 name = C (std::string)
 valid = 1 (bool)
 value = 3 (int)
 visited = 0 (int)
> p D
D (SST::Component)
 component_state_ = 3 (SST::BaseComponent::ComponentState)
 my_info_ ()
 my_info_ (SST::ComponentInfo*)
 name = D (std::string)
 valid = 1 (bool)
 value = 1 (int)
 visited = 0 (int)
```
